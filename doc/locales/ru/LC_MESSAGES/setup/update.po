#: ../../setup/update.rst:22
msgid ""
"Refers to the process of obtaining the latest revision of the source code"
" for your current Odoo Edition. For example, updating your Odoo "
"Enterprise 13.0 to the latest revision. This does not directly cause any "
"change to the contents of your Odoo database, and can be undone by "
"reinstalling the previous revision of the source code."

msgstr ""

#: ../../setup/update.rst:29
msgid ""
"Refers to a complex data processing operation where the structure and "
"contents of your database is permanently altered to make it compatible "
"with a new release of Odoo. This operation is irreversible and typically "
"accomplished via Odoo's `database upgrade service "
"<https://upgrade.odoo.com>`_, when you decide to switch to a newer "
"release of Odoo. Historically, this process has also been known as a "
"\"migration\" because it involves moving data around inside the database,"
" even though the database may end up at the same physical location after "
"the upgrade."

"Updating Odoo is accomplished by simply reinstalling the latest version "

"We always recommend to download a complete new up-to-date Odoo version, "
"rather than manually applying patches, such as the security patches that "
"come with Security Advisories. The patches are mainly provided for "

" prefer to apply minimal changes temporarily while testing a complete "
