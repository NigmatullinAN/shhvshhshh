"In Odoo 10.0 we released a mobile app which allows you to access all "
"**Odoo apps** (even your customized modules)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/mobile.rst:16
msgid ""
"The application is a combination of **Odoo Web** and **Native Mobile "
"components**. In other words it is a Odoo Web instance loaded inside a "
"native, mobile, WebView container."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/mobile.rst:19
msgid ""
"This page documents how you can access mobile native components like "
"Camera, Vibration, Notification and Toast through Odoo Web (via "
"JavaScript). For this, you do not need to be a mobile developer, if you "
"know Odoo JavaScript API you can access all available mobile features."

"Of course, it is a web page that loads on a Mobile Native Web container. "

"WebPages (Odoo Web) is on the top of each layer, where the second layer "

#: ../../reference/mobile.rst:40
msgid ""
"When any call from JavaScript is triggered it passes through Bridge and "
"Bridge passes it to the native invoker to perform that action."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/mobile.rst:43
msgid ""
"When the native component has done its work, it is passed to the Bridge "
"again and you get the output in JavaScript."

"Process time taken by the Native component depends on what you are "
